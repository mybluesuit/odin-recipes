    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup (65g) graham cracker crumbs (about 4–5 full sheet graham crackers)</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons (29g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cheesecake</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>one 8-ounce block (226g) full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60g) full-fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice (optional, but recommended)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>topping suggestions: salted caramel, lemon curd, strawberry topping, chocolate ganache, red wine chocolate ganache, fresh fruit or maraschino cherries, homemade whipped cream, or raspberry sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a standard 12-count muffin pan with 9-10 liners. (For a mini muffin pan, see recipe note.) This recipe yields only 9-10 mini cheesecakes, so there will be 2-3 empty. You could skip the liners and spray the pan with non-stick spray or grease with butter, but the mini cheesecakes are pretty stubborn to release from the pan. I recommend using liners to make things easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the crust:</strong> Combine all of the crust ingredients in a medium bowl. Mixture will be sandy. Firmly press a heaping Tablespoon of crust mixture into each liner. (I use closer to 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons of crust per mini cheesecake.) Pre-bake for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the egg and beat just until combined. Batter will be thick. Divide the batter between all the liners. It’s about 1 Tablespoon per cheesecake.</li>
        <li>Bake until the edges are set and the centers only slightly jiggle, about 18-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Set the pan on a wire rack and allow cheesecakes to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. If chilling for longer than 2 hours, loosely cover the cheesecakes. The cheesecakes will slightly sink in the middle as they chill. It gives you room for toppings!</li>
        <li>Once chilled, add toppings and serve. Cover and store leftover cheesecakes in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
